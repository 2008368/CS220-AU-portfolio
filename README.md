Below i have a "log" which last listed all the necessary progress I have made since Week 1 and I also have a "to do list" which labels everything which I will do in the upcoming weeks of my deadline.

<br>

## Portfolio items
The portfolio I am submitting must contain the following:

1. **website** (40% of your overall mark) - The website which I have decided to make will be structured as the following: I will have a main page which is a general "CV type" website which will just have an introduction on who I am with other necessary information such as links to my social media and emails etc. I will be embedding a file from my repository to my main index file which will be a blog type website on sustainability in the fashion industry specifically focusing on the impacts of "fast fashion" and how it can be improved.
2. **di reflection** (40% of your overall mark) - The website that I have written will be on word however I will copy and paste it onto my Github repository but I am yet to decide whether I want it on my website or not. This will contain a discussion on digital identities and then containing two V&R maps explaining my current digital identity and how I would like to improve it for the future.
3. **self-and peer-assessment** (10% of your overall mark) - the CS220 AU marking rubric in the `assessment.md` file to help streamline your progress. Before you submit, use this file to evaluate your work and give feedback on one of your classmates' work.
4. **portfolio overview** (10% of your overall mark) - a succinct overview of your portfolio and an outline of completed tasks (Log) and tasks to do (TODO) in the `README.md` file. Consider this `README.md` file, the one you are reading now, as a template - change it as necessary.

After you finish these items, add your student number and your portfolio's URL in the `final-check.md` file, complete a checklist in this file and along with the PDF version of your DI reflection, submit it on FASER. 

In essence, you need to submit two files on FASER:

1. di-reflection.pdf
2. final-check.md

But, before you submit, please rename both files to contain your student number e.g. like this:

1. 0610279-di-reflection.pdf
2. 0610279-final-check.md
