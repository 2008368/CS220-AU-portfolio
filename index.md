**Psychology Student at The University of Essex**  

I am an International student born and raised in Cyprus which is a small island near Greece. My decision to move out and study in the UK was very last minute as I left high school a year earlier and started a foundation year here in Essex. Other than the field of Psychology i enjoy sketching as well as following all the faashion trends/news as it is something that inspires me and keeps my creativity active.

# Exploring my favourite 2000s fashion collection
Christian Dior Fall 2000 Ready to Wear
-In this collection, The designer John Galliano crowded the runway with throwaway luxe outfits inspired by the style of contemporary rap world. With the use of different mediums like fur, leather as well as printed newspaper he aimed to create a claasic couture look on the runway show.
- I decided to talk about this specific collection, as I believe it influeneced me as a fashion phanatic as well as other upcoming designers in the industry. This is because, the materials and cuts come together to create a fierce and confident look on the models. It also helped me go outside my comfort zone in terms of colors and textures. Below I will be attaching an image of a specific dress that was designed through the use of a Dior daily newspaper print.

The "Newspaper Dress": A newspaper called "Christian Dior Daily" was created for the runway only and then printed on leather, chiffon and even the reverse side of the fur. Since this day, many brands as well as upcoming designers have been inspired and came out with newspaper printed clothing like tops, pants and even swimwear.
