## Maria Demetriou
**Psychology Student at The University of Essex**  

I am an International student originally born and raised in Cyprus which is a small island near Greece. My decision to move out and study in the UK was very spontaneous and last minute as I left high school a year earlier and started a foundation year here in Essex. Other than the field of Psychology i enjoy sketching as well as following all the faashion trends/news as it is something that inspires me and keeps my creativity active.
