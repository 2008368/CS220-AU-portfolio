I am an International student born and raised in Cyprus which is a small island near Greece.

# Exploring my favourite 2000s fashion collection
Christian Dior Fall 2000 Ready to Wear
-In this collection, The designer John Galliano crowded the runway with throwaway luxe outfits inspired by the style of contemporary rap world. With the use of different mediums like fur, leather as well as printed newspaper he aimed to create a claasic couture look on the runway show.
- I decided to talk about this specific collection, as I believe it influeneced me as a fashion phanatic as well as other upcoming designers in the industry. This is because, the materials and cuts come together to create a fierce and confident look on the models. It also helped me go outside my comfort zone in terms of colors and textures. Below I will be attaching an image of a specific dress that was designed through the use of a Dior daily newspaper print.

The "Newspaper Dress": A newspaper called "Christian Dior Daily" was created for the runway only and then printed on leather, chiffon and even the reverse side of the fur. Since this day, many brands as well as upcoming designers have been inspired and came out with newspaper printed clothing like tops, pants and even swimwear.

# More about John Galliano
He has been one of the most controversial fashion talents as he as much-anticipated his return to fashion. Following a number of false starts regarding financial backers, he relocated to Paris where he put on his first show as part of Paris Fashion Week in 1989. His financial problems finally came to an end with the help of American Vogue Editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and Andre Leon Talley. Bernard Arnault appointed Galliano as the head designer of Givenchy in 1995, which made him the first British designer to head a French haute couture house.Furthermore he was named British Designer of the Year at the British Fashion Awards in 1987,1994,1995,1997. In October the CFDA had moved Galliano to Dior where they dominated the Nefertiti couture collection, the saddlebag. At present time, Galliano is the creative director of Paris based fashion house of Maison Margiela.
