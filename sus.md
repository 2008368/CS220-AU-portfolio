## If not now, then when ? 
<img align="right" width="200" height="183" src="https://www.publicservicedegrees.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/forestry-degree-banner.jpg">Sustainability is nothing new to us and the role we play in our everyday lives ranging from what clothes we wear when we wake up to the goods we buy in the supermarket play a part in how we impact our environment and the world. But how significant and impactful are we as individuals? Although we may only be individual people not contributing a "major" impact, the numbers that add up can count for billions of us resulting in even more damage to the environment than we thought possible. This short blog will discuss the introduction of fast fashion and how it has become a big industry in our society and the impacts this industry has and will cause if we choose now to act now.

## What is Fast Fashion ? 
The beginning of the industrial revolution really solidified the emergence of the fast fashion industry with the garment industry being one of the most critcal sectors for economic development. 
To keep up with current trends which can go viral overnight ranging from Instagram to Tik Tok, fast fashion is an industry inevitable to be introduced in the 21st century. Fast fashion is a term which is used to describe a highly profitable business model based on repeating and relicating many high fashion designs by mass-producing them at a very low cost (Katherine Saxon, 2021). 
However with domestic manufacturing being very expensive, many companies outsource their production in countries with cheaper labour. This often means that workers in these factories are working in inhumane conditions with harmful materials or pesticides which can negatively impact them and the environment.

## The consequences of the Fast Fashion industry
With fashion trends changing as fast as they arrive and the money spent by the world population annually in the fashion industry being 1 Billion dollars, its no wonder the environment and workers in the textile industry have resulted in a significantly worse state since the beginning of the industrial revolution. Approximately 85% of clothing consumed by Americans are sent to landfills as waste every year which says a lot about the impact this industry has on the environment itself. This has lead to major negative impacts which will soon impact our future after continuous destruction to the environment, other species and workers who work in these inhuman conditions.

**Environmental damage**

Roughly 90% of clothing made in the US is made with cotton or polyester which can create multiple health and environmental impacts from the manufacturing process. For example, many practices in factories usually involve doing textile dyeing which can result in several environmental hazards as untreated water which is mixed with the dyes can often be discharged into the local water systems which can release toxicants affecting the health of the environment, also the animals who rely on these water systems for hydration as well as local residents which live in the factories.

**Occupational damage**

All production and manufacturing of clothing to fast fashion brands are done in LMIC'S (Low-middle income countries) due to their very cheap labour compared to more developed countries. Although around 90% of clothing are produced in these countries, there are still several safety hazards which can be detrimental to the health of these workers simply because of the poor political infrastructure and organisational management. All of these issues can lead to serious hazards such as respiratory due to poor ventilation from things such as cotton dust and synthetic air particulates and musculoskeletal hazards from repetitive motion tasks.

## Social Media's influence on fast fashion

In general it's safe to say that Gen z take more part in consumerism than prior generations (millenials, generation x) which could be an alternative explanation for the growth of the fast fashion industry. Social media is notorious for the short lived trends which can go global overnight with many products that are viral being sold out in days or in some cases hours. With many fast fashion brands such as: H&M, Shein and Zara being the frontline of modern fashion and imitating high end brands by mass producing them at a cheaper price, social media platforms have essentially become a medium for consumers to find and purchase these trendy items of clothing. 

Many of these fast fashion brands may not have negative intentions since a lot of people would argue that these brands tailor for people who may not have as much money and need more affordable prices while also taking part in wearing trendy fashion. 

However the main issue that several people have pointed out are the introduction of "hauls". This is when people spend large amounts of money ranging from roughly  to around  or even  on these fast fashion brands that sell very cheap clothing. This is seen as an issue because the individuals who do have the luxury to spend a lot money on clothes, choose to spend on these fast fashion brands with very cheap prices and buy hundreds of pieces only for them to end up thrown away or sent to charity shops.

The majority of these clothes which are mass produced are done with very cheap materials and most likely in third world countries meaning there is a high chance that cheap labour and harmful conditions are exposed to the workers which is only reinforced and promoted since consumers in more developed countries are feeding into this fast fashion trend.

Although the fast fashion industry has been detrimental to the damage of our environment and people living and working in the textile industry in LMIC'S, several charities have attempted to make a change and improve practices of harmful chemicles etc to promote a better quality of life for these workers. 
The video above shows the struggle of cotton farmers in Ethiopia and how the uses of harmful pesticides have negatively affected workers (specifically woman and children) who are vulnerable to harmful pesticides. 
However, the work between Traid and the Ethiopian Bureau of Agrictulture have promoted organic agriculture which would bring massive health benefits to these communities (approximately 360,000 people) which would be beneficial for these farmers in the future.

We previously discussed the negative imapcts of the fast fashion industry on the environment and workers but here we will discuss in depth how garment workers and even their families are being affected by this industry on a daily basis. 

Another project from Traid here shows the negative imapcts and harsh conditions that workers in third world countries have to face. 
Here in Dhaka, Bangladesh single mothers working in the garment industry are normally forced to leave their children alone whilst they work daily usually living off of a very small salary (roughly  pm). 

These families usually live in slums where very young children who have to live alone are vulnerable to trafficking, sexual assault and other accidents.

Similarly, these children grow up to having little to no education meaning some of them are forced into illegal work such as drug trafficking.
However, Childhope UK and Nagorik Uddyog have worked together to form day care centres and drop-in centres for mothers to drop their children while they go off to work. 

This gives many children and infants a chance to obtain a better education which gives them a chance to obtain better jobs in the future to provide for their families hopefully preventing future inter-generational poverty.
