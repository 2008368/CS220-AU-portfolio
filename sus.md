## If not now, then when?


Sustainability is nothing new to us and the role we play in our everyday lives ranging from what clothes we wear when we wake up to the goods we buy in the supermarket play a part in how we impact our environment and the world. But how significant and impactful are we as individuals? Although we may only be individual people not contributing a "major" impact, the numbers that add up can count for billions of us resulting in even more damage to the environment we thought possible.
