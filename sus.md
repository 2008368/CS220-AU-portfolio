## If not now, then when ?
Sustainability is nothing new to us and the role we play in our everyday lives ranging from what clothes we wear when we wake up to the goods we buy in the supermarket play a part in how we impact our environment and the world. But how significant and impactful are we as individuals? Although we may only be individual people not contributing a "major" impact, the numbers that add up can count for billions of us resulting in even more damage to the environment than we thought possible.

## What is Fast Fashion ? 
The beginning of the industrial revolution really solidified the emergence of the fast fashion industry with the garment industry being one of the most critcal sectors for economic development. 
To keep up with current trends which can go viral overnight ranging from Instagram to Tik Tok, fast fashion is an industry inevitable to be introduced in the 21st century. Fast fashion is a term which is used to describe a highly profitable business model based on repeating and relicating many high fashion designs by mass-producing them at a very low cost Katherine Saxon (2021). 
However with domestic manufacturing being very expensive, many companies outsource their production in countries with cheaper labour. This often means that workers in these factories are working in inhumane conditions with harmful materials or pesticides which can negatively impact them and the environment.

## How we are killing ourselves through fast fashion.
With fashion trends changing as fast as they arrive and the money spent by the world population annually in the fashion industry being $1.2 billion, its no wonder the environment and workers in the textile industry have resulted in a significantly worse state since the beginning of the industrial revolution. Approximately 85% of clothing consumed by Americans are sent to landfills as waste every year which says a lot about the impact this industry has on the environment itself.

**Environmental damage**

Roughly 90% of clothing made in the US is made with cotton or polyester which can create multiple health and environmental impacts from the manufacturing process. For example, many practices in factories usually involve doing textile dyeing which can result in several environmental hazards as unreated water which is mixed with the dyes can often be discharged into the local water systems which can release toxicants affecting the health of the environment, also the animals who rely on these water systems for hydration as well as local residents which live in the factories.
